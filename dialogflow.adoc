Google provides access to its awesome human language recognition capabilities through a tool called DialogFlow (https://dialogflow.com/).
This tutorial walks through how to create a basic DialogFlow agent.

== Setting up Intents
Intents are DialogFlow's way of classifying what your users are trying to do when they talk.
Example intents might be:

- Greeting
- Check the weather
- Add a task
- Get directions

DialogFlow agents come with two default intents.
You are free to add to those, delete them, or modify them as you want.

- Click on the "Default Welcome Intent"

Notice that the Intent screen consists of 6 collapsable sections:

- *Contexts* keep track of what you are talking about. If you said "Play me some U2", the contexts could be "Playing music" and "Artist: U2". Then you could say "I want a different song," and knowing the context would allow your app to know you are referring to the music that is playing.
- *Events* are ways to trigger intents without user input.
- *Training phrases* are examples of things your users could say to trigger the intent. For a weather intent, it could include many different examples of how your users might ask about the weather.
- *Actions and parameters* specify _actions_, which are what your agent does in response to the intent, and _parameters_, which are extra data you are trying to use to complete the action.
- *Responses* are pre-programmed responses to the intent. 
- *Fulfillment* is how you get your agent to actually _do_ something in response to an intent.
